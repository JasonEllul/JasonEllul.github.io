<center><h4 class="paddington"><br />Motive is a map-based social network I founded where users can post annotations onto a global map in the form of <i>motives</i>. You can follow an account to view all of their recent motives on your map and then "go" to the post (equivalent of liking a post) as well as add comments.</h4></center>

<center><p class="paddington">Here are a few screenshots of the app running on an iPhone. The left screenshot contains an image of the home map, where you view all of the Motives loaded from your feed on a map. You can press on any of the annotations to see more details about the Motive such as comments, distance from you, nearest address, and who's going. The right screenshot is what the feed looks like; where you can see posts in a tablular view as well as filter between your follower's recent Motives or explore public posts. Pressing any Motive in the table will bring you to the location of that Motive on the home map.</p></center>

<center><p class="paddington">Above is a screenshot of what a user's profile looks like. This is where you can see someone's posted Motives, as well as the Motives they are going to. You can customize your own profile to your liking by changing your profile picture, display name, username, and banner point location. If you set your profile to private then people will need to request to follow you and view your posts.</p></center>

<h3 class="uk-card-title" style="padding-left: 4%; padding-right: 4%;">How It's Made</h3>
<p class="paddington">It all started with me wishing that there was an app I could open on my phone that would show what's going on around me. Despite having all of these social media apps on my phone, there was nothing that enabled me to simply look at a map and see events being posted. I then had the revelation that I'm a software engineer and could make this app a reality myself!
<br /><br />
I began by sketching out what the app would look like and creating the branding. I choose the name Motive because it's catchy, simple, and has a memorable punchline that inspire users to create posts: <i>"What's the Motive?"</i>. I used the site <a href="https://uigradients.com">uigradients.com</a> to find a colour gradient I liked that would suit the app. I choose orange because it accurately portrays the fast paced nature of a social network that shows the user what is currently going on around them. I took design inspiration from SnapChat's SnapMap feature for the map component of the app and Twitter for the text feed. </p>

<center><p class="paddington">Here are one of the early sketches I created for a view that would show the details of a specific post. On the right shows what that same functionality ended up looking like in the app.</p></center>
<br />

<center><p class="paddington">The home map view after many usability tests and visual overhauls. The home map view originally used the native iOS MapKit and the annotations to represent posts were non-customizable flags. I changed the map to MapBox because the actual map tiles looked much more aesthetically pleasing and because iOS MapKit did not contain the map camera/ fly functionality I needed for the home map to animate smoothly. </p></center>

<center><p class="paddington">The profile view after a few design iterations. I took inspiration from Twitter's profile view for the segmented control styling and the top banner layout. </p></center>
<br />
<p class="paddington"><br />Motive is coming to the exclusively on the Apple App Store in 2019. It is currently in open beta and you can download the app onto any iOS device <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/bNDtFSKZ">here</a>.</p>
