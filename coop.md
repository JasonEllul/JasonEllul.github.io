<p class="message">Welcome to my co-op work term reports! In this section of my website I will reflect on the work I've been doing at my co-op placements.</p>
## CCS (Computing and Communications Services) Consultant 
My first co-op placement began in summer 2018, with an 8-month work term at the University of Guelph's IT department, CCS. Despite this only being my first co-op placement, I've already learned so much about my personal goals and had an absolutely amazing experience doing so! I hope that this report will manage to capture the learning experience I've had working for the University of Guelph.

#### Information About the Employer

If you go onto any University of Guelph department website, you will find a brief description of what they do at the university. Here is what we at [CCS](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/) describe as our role within the school community:

> "CCS provides core IT services to the greater campus community. These include internet connectivity, a campus wide integrated email and calendaring system, telephony infrastructure, software distribution, development of single sign-on technology, learning resources, and more."

With technology playing such a vital role in the work done by the campus community, CCS has a strict obligation to keep our services both functional and accessible. Some of the services managed by CCS include: campus-wide internet connectivity, tens of thousands of email accounts, phones and computers for university employees, and, hundreds of various web applications and software used by the wide assortment of roles within the campus community. On top of providing the core IT resources required by a substantial insitution to function, CCS makes these services accessible to all by providing online, on the phone, and in-person support. CCS hosts a variety of websites containing documentation on how to use the services that they provide. For example, I contributed to this [instructional website on how to connect to the secure campus wifi](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/securewireless).
