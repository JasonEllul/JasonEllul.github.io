<p class="message">Welcome to my co-op work term reports! In this section of my website I will reflect on the work I've been doing at my co-op placements.</p>
## CCS (Computing and Communications Services) Consultant
My first co-op placement began in summer 2018, with an 8-month work term at the University of Guelph's IT department, CCS. Despite this only being my first co-op placement, I've already learned so much about my personal goals and had an absolutely amazing experience doing so! I hope that this report will manage to capture the learning experience I've had working for the University of Guelph.

#### Information About the Employer

If you go onto any University of Guelph department website, you will find a brief description of what they do at the university. Here is what we at [CCS](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/) describe as our role within the school community:

> "CCS provides core IT services to the greater campus community. These include internet connectivity, a campus wide integrated email and calendaring system, telephony infrastructure, software distribution, development of single sign-on technology, learning resources, and more."

With technology playing such a vital role in the work done by the campus community, CCS has a strict obligation to keep our services both functional and accessible.
