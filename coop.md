<p class="message">Welcome to my co-op work term reports! In this section of my website I will reflect on the work I've been doing at my co-op placements.</p>
## CCS (Computing and Communications Services) Consultant 
My first co-op placement began in summer 2018, with an 8-month work term at the University of Guelph's IT department, CCS. Despite this only being my first co-op placement, I've already learned so much about my personal goals and had an absolutely amazing experience doing so! I hope that this report will manage to capture the learning experience I've had working for the University of Guelph.

### Information About the Employer

If you go onto any University of Guelph department website, you will find a brief description of what they do at the University. Here is what we at [CCS](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/) describe as our role within the school community:

> "CCS provides core IT services to the greater campus community. These include internet connectivity, a campus wide integrated email and calendaring system, telephony infrastructure, software distribution, development of single sign-on technology, learning resources, and more."

With technology playing such a vital role in the work done by the campus community, CCS has a strict obligation to keep our services both functional and accessible. Some of the services managed by CCS include: campus-wide internet connectivity, tens of thousands of email accounts, phones and computers for university employees, and hundreds of various web applications and software used by the wide assortment of roles within the campus community.

On top of providing the core IT resources required by any substantial insitution to function, CCS makes these services accessible to all by providing online, on the phone, and in-person support. CCS hosts a variety of websites containing documentation for the usage of the services that they provide. For example, I contributed to this instructional website on [how to connect to the secure campus wifi](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/securewireless) by adding new devices and updating the existing screenshots. CCS also provides the IT Help Desk as a free service to assist students, faculty and staff with IT-related questions or problems in person. CCS is located in many locations across campus; such as the Help Centre located in the basement of Johnston Hall, the IT Help Desk in the library, and the executive offices on the third floor of the University Centre.

### Learning Goals

#### Written Communication

Prior to starting my work at CCS, I didn't have much experience with drafting and responding to emails containing technical information. I quickly learned how difficult it can sometimes be to effectively communicate technical information to clients, as they all have varying nomenclature and experience with computers. I made it one of my personal goals to improve my written communication skills to ensure that I was completely and thoroughly understanding of each client's request or issue, and that they were understanding my response. I believe that I accomplished this goal early in the work term from the constant experience I was gaining by responding to clients and writing technical emails to other CCS teams. I was able to communicate better and had a noticible decrease in the amount of "back and forth" between me and a specific client.  This will surely be useful in future work terms since using written communication to convey technical information is a part of any job in computer science.

#### Leadership

A good leader is essential in the workplace to empower team members to work at their full potential and to take  responsibility for decision making. Before working at CCS, I didn't view myself as much of a leader but after this work term I have definitely surpassed my goal of impoving my leadership skills. By taking inititive to be the first one to test new services and being responsible to create documentation for these services, I became the go-to person for other consultants to ask questions about things that they were unfamiliar with. I had to assume the role of a leader and make sure that my colleagues (particulary the part-time staff who didn't work as often) were informed about the changes in our services as well as executing new procedures correctly. I really enjoyed being a leader figure in the workplace and my newfound leadership skills will be beneficial in future co-op work terms as I will likely be working in a collaborative environment again. 

#### Problem Solving

At CCS I was expected to provide expertise to University clients reguarding a wide variety of services that were regularly changing. It almost seemed as if no two requests or issues were the same. I required problem solving skills in order to understand an issue that I have never heard of, and be able to work through it to find a workaround or a solution. I made it a personal goal early on in the work term to hone my problem solving skills so that any tougher issues in the future would be easier to solve. I improved my problem solving skills by trying to work through a client's issue myself as much as I could before needing to ask any managers for advice. Doing this I discovered that the biggest flaw in my problem solving skills is my confidence in the solution. I found that most of the time I wasn't asking my superiors for help finding the solution, I was asking if my proposed solution was the correct one. After I noticed this my problem solving skills drastically improved since I was able to stop worrying if I was wrong and focus on solving difficult issues with confidence. This skill will prove useful in future co-op work placements since problem solving is a crucial skill in either IT support or development. 

### Job Description

As an <b>IT Consultant,</b> I worked closely with CCS IT staff to provide technical troubleshooting, IT information and IT solutions to clients within the University. I was the frontline for any issues, outages, or assistance regaurding the services that CCS provides. Depending on the issue or request, I would have to work very closely with other [CCS teams](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/)  to ensure that the client's requirements were being met. This job required me to have expertise in a wide variety of computing subjects such as networking, security, operating systems, hardware, servers, databases, and browsers in order to ensure I was giving appropriate consultation to clients. I already had varying knowledge in some of these topics from school, but I definitely learned a ton about the technical side of core IT by working alongside the other CCS teams.

One of the most important skills required to be an IT Consultant at the University of Guelph is the ability to communicate technical information properly and effectively. I was required to regularly convey technical information to clients and other IT staff within the University, through both written and vocal communication. Soft skills are constantly demanded by the job as you respond to emails, phone calls, and meet clients in person. Fortunately for me, I started the job with three years of customer service experience from my cashier job at [Hero Burger](https://heroburgers.com/), and I was already comfortable treating clients with confidence and professionalism. However, even with my previous experience, every day at CCS managed to be a learning opportunity for my soft skills.

Every single day on this job is unique. I spent the majority of my time in the Help Center, where I assisted clients with lots of entirely different problems and requests. Some requests would be as simple as ensuring that an employee has permissions to login to a specific computer, others would be much more complicated such as assisting a department administrator choose which type of [LISTSERV](http://www.lsoft.com/) they should create based on their communication needs. I also frequently got to get out of the office and help the other CCS teams with bigger projects; such as doing the BIOS setup on a new shipment of desktops, or installing the latest chemistry software on a room full of lab machines.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, my first co-op term went better then I could have ever imagined. I gained lots of experience working in a collaborative team environment, and improved on soft skills that will be essential to my future co-op work terms. I successfully achieved all of the goals that I set to improve my written communication, leadership, and problem solving skills. By assisting other CCS teams with their projects, I was lucky enough to get hands-on experience in many different areas of IT from a single work term. I enjoyed working with all of the friendly staff and faculty of the University so much that I would definitely consider a career at CCS if the opportunity arose. Overall, I have come a long way from where I started, and it is truely interesting to reflect on how much I have learned in just 8 months. 

### Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Jill Hogg for being such an amazing manager and taking the co-op team under her wing. Also a big thank you to the Service Support team, who helped out the co-op team and constantly made us feel welcome in the workplace. Thank you to my fellow co-op and part time teammates for being such great colleagues and making these past 8 months so enjoyable. I look forward to continually working with everyone as a part-time IT consultant next semester.
