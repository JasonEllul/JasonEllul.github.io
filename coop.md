<p class="message">Welcome to my co-op work term reports! In this section of my website I will reflect on the work I've been doing at my co-op placements.</p>
## CCS (Computing and Communications Services) Consultant 
My first co-op placement began in summer 2018, with an 8-month work term at the University of Guelph's IT department, CCS. Despite this only being my first co-op placement, I've already learned so much about my personal goals and had an absolutely amazing experience doing so! I hope that this report will manage to capture the learning experience I've had working for the University of Guelph.

### Information About the Employer

If you go onto any University of Guelph department website, you will find a brief description of what they do at the University. Here is what we at [CCS](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/) describe as our role within the school community:

> "CCS provides core IT services to the greater campus community. These include internet connectivity, a campus wide integrated email and calendaring system, telephony infrastructure, software distribution, development of single sign-on technology, learning resources, and more."

With technology playing such a vital role in the work done by the campus community, CCS has a strict obligation to keep our services both functional and accessible. Some of the services managed by CCS include: campus-wide internet connectivity, tens of thousands of email accounts, phones and computers for university employees, and hundreds of various web applications and software used by the wide assortment of roles within the campus community.

On top of providing the core IT resources required by any substantial insitution to function, CCS makes these services accessible to all by providing online, on the phone, and in-person support. CCS hosts a variety of websites containing documentation for the usage of the services that they provide. For example, I contributed to this instructional website on [how to connect to the secure campus wifi](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/securewireless) by adding new devices and updating the existing screenshots. CCS also provides the IT Help Desk as a free service to assist students, faculty and staff with IT-related questions or problems in person. CCS is located in many locations across campus; such as the Help Centre located in the basement of Johnston Hall, the IT Help Desk in the library, and the executive offices on the third floor of the University Centre.

### Learning Goals

#### Written Communication

Prior to starting my work at CCS, I didn't have much experience with drafting and responding to emails containing technical information. I quickly learned how difficult it can sometimes be to effectively communicate technical information to clients, as they all have varying nomenclature and experience with computers. I made it one of my personal goals to improve my written communication skills to ensure that I was completely and thoroughly understanding of each client's request or issue, and that they were understanding my response. I believe that I accomplished this goal early in the work term from the constant experience I was gaining by responding to clients and writing technical emails to other CCS teams. I was able to communicate better and had a noticible decrease in the amount of "back and forth" between me and a specific client.  This will surely be useful in future work terms since using written communication to convey technical information is a part of any job in computer science. 

#### Leadership

talk posively about yourself ; people would often come to me for assistance with difficult issues when Jill wasn't around. took inititive to tackle tougher projects first so that you were able to teach others

#### Problem Solving

I was expected to provide expertise to University clients reguarding a wide variety of problems


### Job Description

As an <b>IT Consultant,</b> I worked closely with CCS IT staff to provide technical troubleshooting, IT information and IT solutions to clients within the University. I was the frontline for any issues, outages, or assistance regaurding the services that CCS provides. Depending on the issue or request, I would have to work very closely with other [CCS teams](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/)  to ensure that the client's requirements were being met. This job required me to have expertise in a wide variety of computing subjects such as networking, security, operating systems, hardware, servers, databases, and browsers in order to ensure I was giving appropriate consultation to clients. I already had varying knowledge in some of these topics from school, but I definitely learned a ton about the technical side of core IT by working alongside the other CCS teams. 

One of the most important skills required to be an IT Consultant at the University of Guelph is the ability to communicate technical information properly and effectively. I was required to regularly convey technical information to clients and other IT staff within the University, through both written and vocal communication. Soft skills are constantly demanded by the job as you respond to emails, phone calls, and meet clients in person. Fortunately for me, I started the job with three years of customer service experience from my cashier job at [Hero Burger](https://heroburgers.com/), and I was already comfortable treating clients with confidence and professionalism. However, even with my previous experience, every day at CCS managed to be a learning opportunity for my soft skills.

Every single day on this job is unique. I spent the majority of my time in the Help Center, where I assisted clients with lots of entirely different problems and requests. Some requests would be as simple as ensuring that an employee has permissions to login to a specific computer, others would be much more complicated such as assisting a department administrator choose which type of [LISTSERV](http://www.lsoft.com/) they should create based on their communication needs. I also frequently got to get out of the office and help the other CCS teams with bigger projects; such as doing the BIOS setup on a new shipment of desktops, or installing the latest chemistry software on a room full of lab machines. 

### Conclusion

In conclusion, my first co-op term went better then I could have ever imagined. I gained lots of experience working in a collaborative team environment, and improved on soft skills that will be essential to my future co-op work terms. I successfully achieved all of the goals that I set to improve my written communication, leadership, and problem solving skills. By assisting other CCS teams with their projects, I was lucky enough to get hands-on experience in many different areas of IT from a single work term. I enjoyed working with all of the friendly staff and faculty of the University so much that I would definitely consider a career at CCS if the opportunity arose. Overall, I have come a long way from where I started, and it is truely interesting to reflect on how much I have learned in just 8 months. 

### Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Jill Hogg for being such an amazing manager and taking the co-op team under her wing. Also a big thank you to the Service Support team, who helped out the co-op team and constantly made us feel welcome in the workplace. Thank you to my fellow co-op and part time teammates for being such great colleagues and making these past 8 months so enjoyable. I look forward to continually working with everyone as a part-time IT consultant next semester.
