## CCS (Computing and Communications Services) Consultant
Welcome to my co-op work term report! In this section of my website I will reflect on the work I've been doing at my co-op placement. My first co-op placement began in summer 2018, with an 8-month work term at the University of Guelph's IT department, CCS. Despite this only being my first co-op placement, I've already learned so much about my personal goals and had an absolutely amazing experience doing so. I hope that this report will manage to capture the learning experience I've had working for the University of Guelph.
