<center><p class="paddington"><br>Motive is a map-based social network I founded where users can post annotations onto a global map in the form of <i>motives</i>. You can follow an account to view all of thier recent motives on your map and then "go" to the post (equivalent of liking a post) as well as add comments.</p></center>


<h3 class="uk-card-title" style="padding-left: 4%; padding-right: 4%;">How It's Made</h3>
<p class="paddington">It all started with me wishing that there was an app I could open on my phone that would show what's going on around me. Despite having all of these social media apps on my phone, there was nothing that enabled me to simply look at a map and see events being posted. I then had the revelation that I'm a software engineer and could make this app a reality myself!
<br><br>
I began by sketching out what the app would look like and creating the branding. I choose the name Motive because it's catchy, simple, and has a memorable punchline that inspire users to create posts: <i>"What's the Motive?"</i>. I used the site <a href="https://uigradients.com">uigradients.com</a> to find a colour gradient I liked that would suit the app. I choose orange because it accurately portrays the fast paced nature of a social network that shows the user what is currently going on around them. I took design inspiration from SnapChat's SnapMap feature for the map component of the app and Twitter for the text feed. 
</p>


<p class="paddington"><br>Motive is coming to the exclusively on the Apple App Store in 2019. It is currently in open Beta and you can contact me if you would like to test the application.</p>

The rest of this page is currently a work in progress as I finish developing Motive... stay tuned for updates!
